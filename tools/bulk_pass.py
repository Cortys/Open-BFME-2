"""Shared runner for mechanical passes: apply, verify per file, keep what
holds, revert the rest, commit in batches.

A pass hands over, per source file, a list of independent edits (each a
label and a text -> text function). For every file the runner applies all of
them and byte-verifies the file with ./build.sh. When that fails, it does not
throw the file away: it tries each edit alone on the original, keeps the ones
that verify, and verifies the kept set together (shrinking it greedily if
two good edits interfere). A file ends either verified with its edits or
restored byte-for-byte. Only ./build.sh decides; the runner never loosens a
gate, and commits go through the hooks like any other.

Library use:

    import bulk_pass
    bulk_pass.run({"Code/A.cpp": [("g_00BFDF8C", fn), ...], ...},
                  label="name_globals", commit_every=20)
