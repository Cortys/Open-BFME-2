//
// The body sits immediately above the rowed 0x006C3840 lock-guarded setter
// (Rva006C3840Cluster.cpp) and shares its Rva006C1F60 layout, so the class, the
// 0x006C33D0 callee and the +0x4E4 lock are already established.
//
// Its callee 0x00033D50 was named nowhere in the ledger and is now pinned as an
// address-derived member of this class. That it is a MEMBER rather than a free
// function is target evidence, not a guess: 0x33D50 AddRefs this+0x4E4 on
// entry, walks the +0x49C map and the +0x448 sentinel list, then stores 0 to
// +0x4E4 and Release/Deletes the lock -- memory_pool.cpp already proves +0x448
// as a list sentinel and +0x4E4 as a Lock*, and Rva006C1F60.cpp proves +0x4E4
// on this class. It is also reached through the jump thunk 0x00034D00.
//
// Structural inference, NOT proven identity: 0x6C38D0 propagates the byte
// 0x33D50 returns and invokes it on the same object, so it reads as a
// teardown/flush predicate that always clears the +0x510 byte.
//
// +0x678 is read as a self-pointer: this body compares it against `this` and
// calls 0x006C17B0 on the +0x684 sub-object only when they are equal. Field
// labels below are descriptive; only the offsets are target facts.
//
// The sibling body at 0x006C3940 was recovered from the same neighbourhood and
// is banked as a partial attempt (reverse/attempts/0x006c3940.cpp, score 0.72):
// its fencepost sequence and retry semantics are byte-exact, but MSVC 7.1
// rotates every loop form into a two-call shape instead of retail's single
// allocation with the back-edge at 0x006C3966. Its layout findings are
// retained below because they come from its retail bytes.

// fields are touched here, because 0x6C38D0 inlines the four stores instead of
// calling the 0x006C17B0 body. The field WIDTHS below are target facts, read
// off the stores themselves: +0x684, +0x68C and +0x694 take a DWORD while
// +0x688 takes a BYTE, so the field at +4 is a byte and not the int the rowed
// Rva006C17B0.cpp view happens to carry.
