// NetCommandRef::~NetCommandRef at 0x0058B8AE is 12 bytes. The target-rowed

// NetCommandMsg::detach; BFME1's donor dtor has the same guarded release body.
// Target layout evidence: NetCommandRef and NetCommandNode both hold m_msg at
// +0, followed by their list links. This is a real second identity folded onto
// the identical detach body, not a rename of the node operation.
